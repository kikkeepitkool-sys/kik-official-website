    <h1>Why Is Malaysia Getting Hotter? And How to Stay Cool in Daily Life</h1>

    <p><strong>Published on: 19 February 2026</strong></p>

    <p>
      Many Malaysians have been saying the same thing recently — “Why so hot nowadays?”
      Whether you’re playing outdoor sports, commuting to work, or just walking under the afternoon sun, 
      the heat feels stronger, heavier, and more draining than before.
    </p>

    <h2>Is Malaysia Really Getting Hotter?</h2>

    <p>
      Yes. Rising global temperatures, rapid urban development, and changing weather patterns are contributing to hotter days across Malaysia.
      Cities especially experience what is known as the <strong>urban heat island effect</strong>, where buildings, roads and concrete surfaces absorb and trap heat.
